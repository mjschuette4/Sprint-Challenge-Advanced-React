- [ ] Why would you use class component over function components (removing hooks from the question)?

    `Class components have state and life cycle methods.`

- [ ] Name three lifecycle methods and their purposes.

    `componentDidMount: runs at the start of the lifecycle.`
    `componentDidUpdate: runs everytime there is a change in the render method`
    `componentDidWillUnmount: usually used at the end of the lifecycle to clean up data leaks.`

- [ ] What is the purpose of a custom hook?

    `A hook that you build on your own to apply non-visual behavior and stateful logic throughout your component by applying DRY principals using the same hook over and over again.`

- [ ] Why is it important to test our apps?

    `It helps us to find and fix bugs before pushing our code to production.`
